# Reinforcement Learning

This folder contains details to develop a reinforcement learning model as its basic level to discover how it learns and develop smartness

#### Note of designing a robot (13 Mar 2025)
After having tried to design a Reinforcement Learning problem, specifically the path finding problem, I realize the importance of localization.
Localization helps determine the current position of the robot, as well as support path finding for the next steps in the maze.
