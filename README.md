# Robotic_dog

#### Problem statement

What would happen if we try to replicate a so-called living being?

This idea piqued my interest as a shower thought, and it might have clashed with a tons of ethical standards already. Nevertheless, the sky is the limit, and I might never come near to the conclusion of anything, but I would still want to try how far I can go as a learner, an engineer and a loving person to create something that may try to resemble the best out of a "living creature".

This project is a combination of ultimately everything in constructing a robotic dog, from constructing mechanical skeletal form resembling a dog to actually deploying a model as its brain so that it might actually "walk and talk" after a sequence of training.
